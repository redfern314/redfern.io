              p I'm a member of the REVO Sensing Subteam. We develop logic-level electronics for our electric go-kart and other vehicles. The subteam as a whole has worked on many different projects, including: hall effect sensor, battery management system, BLE, CAN, IMU, and others.
              p My personal deliverables have included developing a CAN network based on the AVR ATMega16M1 for the club go-kart and creating a BLE link (through the Nordic NRF8001) to an Android data display app. These projects, respectively, enabled cross-sensor communication and allowed the driver to see the current kart statistics in an easy-to-read way.
              p During my junior year, I acted as the subteam leader, facilitating PCB fabrication and teaching incoming members about microcontrollers and how to start developing firmware.

              p Frustrated with Olin's convention of using Microsoft Exchange for both mail and scheduling (even though Outlook doesn't function on Linux), I decided to make Olin students' schedules available through a web interface based on Node.JS (with the help of a few other students). You'll need an Olin ID to get to access schedules on the webapp, but 
                a(href="https://github.com/redfern314/oCal") here's the code behind the app!
